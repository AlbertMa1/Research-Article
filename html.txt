        TechSmith is a software development company, that creates a
variety of small programs to enhance the users computer experience.
They sell mainly video recording and screen capturing software on
their website. I chose TechSmith because the place that I work at
works closely with Techsmith products, and the things we use like
Snag it or Camtasia are used to create a multitude of content that we
see on d2l every day.<BR><BR>         For media hosting they use a
lot of 3rd party websites such as screencast.com to store their
content. It seems like for most of their programs they would either
have a 3rd party storage site or recommend that content be uploaded
to your own FTP servers on the client side. On the server side
TechSmith has used direct-attached-storage on five servers to store
the content which have  a total of more than 150 terabytes of data.
Due to the high management costs and poor reporting of the website,
TechSmith decided to switch to the Microsoft Azure platform for
product development and host production workloads. Microsoft Azure is
a public cloud environment that provides virtual computing,
networking, storage, and other resources for developing and hosting
applications in Microsoft datacenters. Techsmith also purchased two
StorSimple devices to lower storage costs and enable offsite disaster
recovery. The primary application servers currently store data on a
storage area network (SAN).</FONT></P>

uses the Digital River network for secure ad and virus free shopping
protection. The Digital River is a company that provides global
ecommerce, payments in marketing services for multiple companies.
They seem to be driving one of the largest commerce management
businesses globally, that take care of a wide range of things from
payment securities to business infrastructure. To keep their networks
protected they keep routine patch checks on Windows Server, ISS, SQL
server, TechSmith Relay, LDAF server software, etc. to make sure that
all their vulnerabilities are in check, which fix previously
discovered vulnerabilities.<BR><BR>            To handle deployment,
they created multiple guides online on how to use all their software.
Most of them are created for educational purposes. The focus of their
products are around screen capture and recording software. Most of
their software they do create is listed as open source software
listed under the end user license agreement.</FONT></P>
